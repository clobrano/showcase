# This tool lets you create really engaging demos by simulating real-time typing.
# Any line of text, like this one, that starts with a hashtag...
# ...will appear on the screen as if I'm typing it live. Pretty neat, right?

# But it gets better! We can also execute commands *within* the demo.
# Let's try that.
! sleep 1

# Lines starting with a dollar sign "$" are treated as commands.
# The command itself is displayed, just like you'd type it in your terminal...

$ ls -l  # Listing files with details

# ...and then, boom! The output appears.

# See how that works? It's great for showing command-line tools in action.
! sleep 1

# Now, for the magic behind the scenes...

# Sometimes, you need to set things up *without* cluttering the demo.
# That's where lines starting with an exclamation mark "!" come in.
# These are *silent commands*. They execute immediately, but their output is hidden.

! echo "Hello World" > helloworld.txt  # Creating a file silently

# You didn't see anything happen, but trust me, it did.
# Let's prove it.

$ ls -l  # Listing files again

# See that new `helloworld.txt` file? It was created by the silent command.
! sleep 1

# And just to wrap things up:

$ cat helloworld.txt  # Showing the file's contents

# There's our "Hello World!"

# Finally, let's clean up.

$ rm helloworld.txt  # Removing the file
$ ls -l

# And that's it! A quick demo showing how you can combine simulated typing with real and silent commands.

# This makes demos easier for you to script, and much more dynamic and easier to follow.
